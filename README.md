# Capstone Project

## Abstract

This project is built with the aim of helping students make informed decisions when it comes to choosing their college majors. Many students make the wrong choices by relying on unverified information from the [internet](https://www.detik.com/edu/detikpedia/d-5828770/87-persen-mahasiswa-ri-merasa-salah-jurusan-apa-sebabnya), without realizing that the decision is more complex than that. Additionally, factors such as peer pressure, the desire to prove oneself, environmental influences, parental pressure, and more contribute to this issue. 

The advantages of this application lie in its features that include talent interest tests, brain preference tests, major suitability tests, major recommendations, and recommendations from close friends. All of these features are supported by machine learning technology and cloud computing. The hope is that this application can serve as a safe and reliable source of information for students before they make decisions about their college majors and plan their future.
